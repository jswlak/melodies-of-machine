# 🧠 Neural Network Basics

Welcome to the **Neural Network Basics** section of the `melodies_of_machine` deep learning repository. This folder is dedicated to building a solid foundational understanding of how neural networks work — from the structure of a single neuron to full training cycles with optimizers and regularization.
