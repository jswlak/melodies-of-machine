# 🧩 Unsupervised Learning

This folder contains step-by-step implementations of **unsupervised machine learning algorithms**, from scratch and using libraries, with practical projects.  
The goal is to master clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and association rule learning.

    🌟 Inspiration
    "Unsupervised learning is like exploring a new city without a map — you discover patterns you didn’t even know existed."

If you want, I can also prepare a **visual roadmap diagram** for all unsupervised learning topics in this folder so your README will stand out on GitHub.  
Do you want me to create that diagram next?
